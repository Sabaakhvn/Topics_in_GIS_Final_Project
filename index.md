                <h3>Need Score Methodology</h3>
                <p>To identify priority areas for affordable housing development, a composite "Need Score" was created by normalizing and combining four key indicators:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Rent Burden</strong>: Percentage of renter households spending 30% or more of income on rent</li>
                    <li><strong>Owner Burden</strong>: Percentage of owner households spending 30% or more on housing costs</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-Income Population</strong>: Percentage of households with annual income below $75,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Demographic Composition</strong>: Percentage of people of color</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Each indicator was normalized using min-max scaling to create a 0-1 scale:</p>
                <pre>Normalized_Value = (Raw_Value - Minimum_Value) / (Maximum_Value - Minimum_Value)</pre>
                
                <p>The Need Score was calculated as the average of the four normalized indicators:</p>
                <pre>Need_Score = (Norm_RentBurden + Norm_OwnerBurden + Norm_LowIncome + Norm_POC) / 4</pre>
            </div>

                <h3>Priority Areas for Development</h3>
                <p>The combined analysis of Need Score and vacant parcel distribution identifies several high-priority areas for affordable housing development, particularly in the eastern and central portions of Clifton.</p>

            <h2>Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>
            
            <p>Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following recommendations are proposed for affordable housing development in Clifton:</p>
            
            <div class="conclusion-item">
                <strong>Prioritize Eastern Census Tracts</strong>: Focus affordable housing development in eastern Clifton where Need Scores are highest and multiple vacant parcels are available.
            </div>
            
            <div class="conclusion-item">
                <strong>Leverage Transit-Oriented Development</strong>: Target vacant parcels within 0.25 miles of bus stops or 0.5 miles of train stations to maximize accessibility for lower-income residents without vehicles.
            </div>
            
            <div class="conclusion-item">
                <strong>Diversify Housing Stock</strong>: Develop a mix of housing types, including apartments and multi-family residential buildings, particularly in areas currently dominated by single-family homes.
            </div>
            
            <div class="conclusion-item">
                <strong>Public-Private Partnerships</strong>: Establish partnerships with private developers to maximize the development potential of vacant land, particularly where corporate ownership is present.
            </div>
            
            <div class="conclusion-item">
                <strong>Tax Revenue Optimization</strong>: Consider mixed-use developments that include commercial components to optimize tax revenue generation while still providing affordable housing units.
            </div>
            
            <div class="conclusion-item">
                <strong>Inclusionary Zoning</strong>: Implement inclusionary zoning policies requiring a percentage of affordable units in new residential developments, particularly in areas with high median incomes.

            <h2>Limitations and Further Research</h2>
            
            <p>This analysis has several limitations that could be addressed in future research:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Currency</strong>: Some demographic data may not capture recent changes in population or housing patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Zoning Constraints</strong>: This analysis does not incorporate current zoning regulations that may limit development potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Factors</strong>: Potential environmental constraints on vacant parcels are not considered.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Dynamics</strong>: Current market conditions and developer interest are not fully captured.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Additional data sources that would enhance the analysis include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed zoning and land use regulations</li>
                <li>Utility infrastructure capacity</li>
                <li>Brownfield or contamination site data</li>
                <li>Housing permits and pipeline projects</li>
                <li>School enrollment and capacity data</li>
                <li>Detailed parcel-level ownership information</li>
