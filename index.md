                <p>Vacant parcels in Clifton are not randomly distributed but show distinct clustering patterns along major transportation corridors and in areas with lower land values. The choropleth map below shows the land value per square foot across Clifton, with vacant parcels highlighted in magenta.</p>

                <h3>Transit Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The analysis of transit accessibility was conducted using ESRI's Network Analyst tool to evaluate pedestrian connectivity to public transportation. Service areas were calculated to precisely delineate zones within a 0.25-mile walking distance of bus stops and a 1.0-mile walking distance of train stations, accounting for the actual street network rather than simple Euclidean distance. This methodology provides a more accurate representation of transit accessibility that reflects real-world pedestrian movement patterns.</p>

                <h3>Spatial Clustering of Public Transit</h3>
                <p>To further understand the spatial distribution of public transit in Clifton, Optimized Hot Spot Analysis was performed. This geostatistical method identifies statistically significant spatial clusters of high values (hot spots) and low values (cold spots) using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. The analysis reveals three distinct hot spot clusters of transit service concentration within Clifton, with the most intense clustering (99% confidence) appearing in the northeastern section of the city. These high-confidence hot spots represent areas where transit accessibility is significantly higher than would be expected by random chance, indicating strategic opportunities for transit-oriented affordable housing development.</p>

                <p>The hot spot analysis reinforces the transit accessibility findings by quantitatively identifying areas where multiple transit routes converge, creating nodes of exceptional connectivity. The northeastern cluster, in particular, corresponds with areas of higher housing need scores, creating an ideal intersection of transit access and affordable housing demand. These statistically significant clusters should be prioritized when considering locations for transit-oriented affordable housing development.</p>

                <h3>Need Score Methodology</h3>
                <p>To identify priority areas for affordable housing development, a composite "Need Score" was created by normalizing and combining four key indicators:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Rent Burden</strong>: Percentage of renter households spending 30% or more of income on rent</li>
                    <li><strong>Owner Burden</strong>: Percentage of owner households spending 30% or more on housing costs</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-Income Population</strong>: Percentage of households with annual income below $75,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Demographic Composition</strong>: Percentage of people of color</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Each indicator was normalized using min-max scaling to create a 0-1 scale:</p>
                <pre>Normalized_Value = (Raw_Value - Minimum_Value) / (Maximum_Value - Minimum_Value)</pre>
                
                <p>The Need Score was calculated as the average of the four normalized indicators:</p>
                <pre>Need_Score = (Norm_RentBurden + Norm_OwnerBurden + Norm_LowIncome + Norm_POC) / 4</pre>

        <h3>Past: Active Industrial Operations (1995)</h3>
        <img src="images/site-1995.jpg" alt="Clifton Railroad Corporation site in 1995" class="full-width-image">
        <p>The 1995 black and white satellite image reveals an actively functioning industrial site characteristic of mid-to-late 20th century rail operations in northern New Jersey. Key features visible in this earliest image include:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple large warehouse structures with distinctive long, rectangular footprints</li>
            <li>Extensive paved areas used for vehicle and material storage</li>
            <li>Clear signs of industrial activity throughout the property</li>
            <li>A well-defined operational footprint extending across the full parcel</li>
            <li>Adjacent residential neighborhoods with clear boundaries from the industrial zone</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>During this period, Clifton's industrial corridor, which includes this site, played an important role in the regional economy. The railroad infrastructure facilitated the movement of goods and materials, supporting manufacturing and distribution activities throughout Passaic County.</p>

    <div class="finding">
        <h3>Transition Period: Early Signs of Change (2010)</h3>
        <img src="images/site-2010.jpg" alt="Clifton Railroad Corporation site in 2010" class="full-width-image">
        <p>By 2010, the color satellite imagery shows notable changes to the site, marking the beginning of a transition in its usage patterns:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Warehouse structures remain intact, maintaining their original configuration</li>
            <li>More clearly defined storage areas and vehicle parking zones</li>
            <li>Some sections show reduced activity compared to the 1995 image</li>
            <li>Surrounding residential areas remain stable with little apparent change</li>
            <li>Increased vegetation visible along the site periphery</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This transition period coincides with broader economic shifts affecting industrial properties throughout northern New Jersey. While the site maintained operational functionality, the imagery suggests a less intensive use of certain areas compared to the earlier period.</p>

        <h3>Recent Past: Declining Industrial Activity (2020)</h3>
        <img src="images/site-2020.jpg" alt="Clifton Railroad Corporation site in 2020" class="full-width-image">
        <p>The 2020 satellite image demonstrates more pronounced changes to the site's usage:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Continued operation of the main warehouse structures</li>
            <li>Significantly fewer vehicles and containers visible on the property</li>
            <li>Larger portions of the site appear underutilized</li>
            <li>Some areas showing apparent disuse or reduced maintenance</li>
            <li>Greater vegetation encroachment in peripheral areas</li>
            <li>Unchanged residential context surrounding the site</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This period reflects the continued decline in traditional industrial activities that has affected many similar properties in the region. While the site maintains some operational aspects, the imagery indicates substantial portions no longer support intensive industrial use.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="finding">
        <h3>Present Conditions: Underutilization and Opportunity (2024)</h3>
        <img src="images/site-2024.jpg" alt="Clifton Railroad Corporation site in 2024" class="full-width-image">
        <p>The most recent imagery from 2024 shows further evolution of the site:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Warehouse structures still present but with visible signs of reduced activity</li>
            <li>Substantially decreased vehicle and material storage</li>
            <li>Large sections appear vacant or minimally utilized</li>
            <li>Maintained access to transportation infrastructure</li>
            <li>Stable surrounding residential context</li>
            <li>Continued integration with the urban fabric of Clifton</li>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <div class="conclusion-box">
            <p>The Clifton Railroad Corporation site illustrates the evolution of industrial properties in northern New Jersey over recent decades. From active industrial operations in 1995 to the current underutilized state in 2024, the changes visible in satellite imagery reflect broader economic transitions affecting similar properties throughout the region.</p>
            <p>The site now presents a significant opportunity for affordable housing development that could leverage existing infrastructure and transit accessibility while addressing community needs. At 3.076 acres, it offers an ideal scale for an efficient affordable housing project - large enough to make a meaningful impact on housing availability but small enough to be financially feasible for municipal or non-profit developers. Through thoughtful planning that respects both the site's industrial heritage and its urban context, this compact property could transform from an underutilized industrial remnant to a vibrant residential community serving Clifton's future.</p>

            <h2>Limitations and Further Research</h2>
            
            <p>This analysis has several limitations that could be addressed in future research:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Currency</strong>: Some demographic data may not capture recent changes in population or housing patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Zoning Constraints</strong>: This analysis does not incorporate current zoning regulations that may limit development potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Factors</strong>: Potential environmental constraints on vacant parcels are not considered.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Dynamics</strong>: Current market conditions and developer interest are not fully captured.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Additional data sources that would enhance the analysis include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed zoning and land use regulations</li>
                <li>Utility infrastructure capacity</li>
                <li>Brownfield or contamination site data</li>
                <li>Housing permits and pipeline projects</li>
                <li>School enrollment and capacity data</li>
            </ul>
