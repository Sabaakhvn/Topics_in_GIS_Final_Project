                    <li><strong>Income Distribution:</strong> Significant income disparities exist across Clifton, with median household incomes ranging from over $119,300 in the western neighborhoods to less than $37,800 in the northeastern section.</li>
                    <li><strong>Housing Cost Burden:</strong> A substantial proportion of Clifton's renters experience housing cost burden, with several census tracts showing that over 66% of renter households spend 30% or more of their income on housing costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Racial and Ethnic Patterns:</strong> Clifton's eastern neighborhoods show higher concentrations of Hispanic or Latino populations, correlating with areas of higher housing cost burden.</li>

                <p>Vacant parcels in Clifton are not randomly distributed but show distinct clustering patterns along major transportation corridors and in areas with lower land values. The choropleth map below shows the land value per square foot across Clifton, with vacant parcels highlighted in magenta.</p>

                <h3>Transit Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The analysis of transit accessibility was conducted using ESRI's Network Analyst tool to evaluate pedestrian connectivity to public transportation. Service areas were calculated to precisely delineate zones within a 0.25-mile walking distance of bus stops and a 1.0-mile walking distance of train stations, accounting for the actual street network rather than simple Euclidean distance. This methodology provides a more accurate representation of transit accessibility that reflects real-world pedestrian movement patterns.</p>

            <div class="finding">
                <h3>Need Score Methodology</h3>
                <p>To identify priority areas for affordable housing development, a composite "Need Score" was created by normalizing and combining four key indicators:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Rent Burden</strong>: Percentage of renter households spending 30% or more of income on rent</li>
                    <li><strong>Owner Burden</strong>: Percentage of owner households spending 30% or more on housing costs</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-Income Population</strong>: Percentage of households with annual income below $75,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Demographic Composition</strong>: Percentage of people of color</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Each indicator was normalized using min-max scaling to create a 0-1 scale:</p>
                <pre>Normalized_Value = (Raw_Value - Minimum_Value) / (Maximum_Value - Minimum_Value)</pre>
                
                <p>The Need Score was calculated as the average of the four normalized indicators:</p>
                <pre>Need_Score = (Norm_RentBurden + Norm_OwnerBurden + Norm_LowIncome + Norm_POC) / 4</pre>
            </div>

            <div class="finding">
                <h3>Priority Areas for Development</h3>
                <p>The combined analysis of Need Score and vacant parcel distribution identifies several high-priority areas for affordable housing development, particularly in the eastern and central portions of Clifton. In our site selection methodology, we prioritized municipally-owned vacant parcels to streamline development by avoiding potential condemnation proceedings and associated legal complexities. The analysis identified only two municipal vacant parcels within the study area, with the parcel located in the north-central region emerging as the optimal development site based on multiple criteria:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Strategic location within a census tract exhibiting high affordable housing need scores</li>
                    <li>Exceptional transit connectivity with proximity to multiple bus stops, enhancing accessibility for transit-dependent residents</li>
                    <li>Potential for integration with existing community infrastructure and services</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Limitations and Further Research</h2>
            
            <p>This analysis has several limitations that could be addressed in future research:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Currency</strong>: Some demographic data may not capture recent changes in population or housing patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Zoning Constraints</strong>: This analysis does not incorporate current zoning regulations that may limit development potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Factors</strong>: Potential environmental constraints on vacant parcels are not considered.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Dynamics</strong>: Current market conditions and developer interest are not fully captured.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Additional data sources that would enhance the analysis include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed zoning and land use regulations</li>
                <li>Utility infrastructure capacity</li>
                <li>Brownfield or contamination site data</li>
